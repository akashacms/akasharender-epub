# @akashacms/plugins-epub -- AkashaCMS plugin to assist building EPUB

This plugin configures AkashaCMS/AkashaRender to produce XHTML files corresponding to EPUB3 specifications.  With it, one can produce a directory structure that can be bundled to create an EPUB.  A companion tool, the [EPUBTools](https://akashacms.com/epubtools/toc.html) project, is a tool for bundling EPUB files.  The two are designed to work together.
