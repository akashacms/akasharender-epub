# @akashacms/plugins-epub -- AkashaCMS plugin to assist building EPUB

This plugin configures AkashaCMS/AkashaRender to produce XHTML files corresponding to EPUB3 specifications.  By itself this is not sufficient to produce an EPUB.  With the companion [EPUBTools](https://akashacms.com/epubtools/toc.html) project, you have a complete toolchain to produce EPUB3 documents from Markdown files.
