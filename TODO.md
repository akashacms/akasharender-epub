Goal... Develop a simple-to-setup experience for editing EPUB ebooks.  It must support the following:

* Live preview editing, using Markdown or AsciiDoc, preview in browser
    * Existing watch-epub along with live-server
* Live rebuild of EPUB
    * TODO - how to automate mkmeta/package commands?
* Batch build of EPUB
    * Existing render command, plus epubtools
* Option for integrating with an AkashaCMS website (epub-website)
    * This means a command which handles epub-website easily


Tasks...

* When will akasharender#watcher be declared finalized?  Soon?
* Screencast series showing how
* Blog posts that cross post to Medium about how
* Rewrite/update the EPUB's from Markdown book?
